# fib - a fibonacci interpreter, for any given (programming) language

The program *fibonacci* interprets any given text file through the fibonacci sequence.

It starts by numbering every word of the text file, and then prints (reads!) the ones whose attributed number is part of the fibonacci sequence, in the same order as they appear in the sequence.

This program is strictly an interpreter, in the theatrical sense of the word. It does not store user-defined variables nor functions.

Written in Python.
